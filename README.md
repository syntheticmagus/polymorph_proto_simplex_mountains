# polymorph_proto_simplex_mountains
A simple mountain heightmap generator created to exhibit and explore potential architectural decisions for Polymorph.

In particular, this repo was intended to help me better understand some possibilities surrounding build systems, morph 
distribution/compatibility, and to what degree functionality should be confined to morphs versus left to wander more
freely for parts of the code that aren't intended to be reusable.
